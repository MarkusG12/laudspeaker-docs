### Prerequisites[](#prerequisites "Direct link to heading")

There are a few prerequisites

- Slack app
- Mailgun Account
- Render Account

Even though you do not need to use our slack integration or use mailgun as the
email sender, right now we require you to have these accounts to self deploy.
Setting up a slack app is easy and free
[here](https://api.slack.com/start/building).

Setting up the Prerequisites shouldn't take more than 5 - 10 mins

## Steps[](#steps "Direct link to heading")

1. Create a render account. They may ask for billing information but your usage
   of Laudspeaker is unlikely to go past the free usage limits. Then in the
   render dashboard, click on environment groups, then create environment group
   with name "laudspeaker" (no capitals). Add the env vars below and shown in
   the screenshot:

- MAGIC_EMAIL_DOMAIN
- MAGIC_EMAIL_KEY
- MAILGUN_API_KEY
- MAILGUN_DOMAIN
- MAILGUN_TEST_DOMAIN
- SLACK_CLIENT_ID
- SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET
- SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET

MAGIC_EMAIL_DOMAIN, MAILGUN_DOMAIN, and MAILGUN_TEST_DOMAIN can all be the same
if you wish. All other values are easily found from the prerequisites

1. This will take you to the render deployment page. Give your deployment a name
   and select the "production" branch. Then click "apply". See screenshot

1. Click on the dashboard tab and wait for the laudspeaker mongo service to
   finish deploying successfully. See screenshot for a finished mongo deploy.

1. Click on the mongo service, and navigate to the shell tab in the side panel.
   Wait for an active shell to appear. See screenshot.

1. Run the command `mongosh --eval "rs.initiate()"` in the shell. The output
   should look as shown in the screenshot.

1. Once the laudspeaker web service is successfully deployed on the dashboard,
   visit the render url to see the deployed instance of laudspeaker.

1. Go ahead and play around - you don't need to verify your email, everything
   should still work!
2. When you are done playing around you can suspend the services on render to
   make sure you are not charged!
