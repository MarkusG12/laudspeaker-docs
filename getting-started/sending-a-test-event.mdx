This is what the final result will look like:

![tre](/images/guides/getting-started/journeywithtrigger-a15b1be51e22289900eb1ab889dc1e5b.png)

At a high level this is how the journey will work:

- User signs up to your service
- Your service notifies Laudspeaker that a new user signed up
- Laudspeaker searches through your active journeys
- Laudspeaker finds the user has activated a trigger in a specific journey
- Laudspeaker moves the user to the next step in that journey
- The next step includes an an email message, so Laudspeaker sends a Welcome
  e-mail to the User.

### Some set up[](#some-set-up "Direct link to heading")

For this you’ll need:

- A free Laudspeaker account
- A free Postman account
- A working e-mail address
  - If you’re just testing out Laudspeaker, I’d recommend using a temporary
    email service.

I’m Using Laudspeaker’s Free3 email as my E-mail provider. This sends up to 3
test e-mails to my account e-mail to help try out Laudspeaker. You can copy
these settings to follow along.

1. Create Journey
   1. Navigate to Journey Builder
   2. Click the Create Journey button
   3. I’ll call mine “two-step-journey” (keep note of this)
   4. Click Create.
   5. You might see a warning referring to no Customer Segment. This means our
      audience is not yet defined. Let’s target the person we added in the
      previous segment.
   6. Click “Define Segment in the dashboard near “Journey Type”.  
      ![warning](/images/guides/getting-started/segmentwarning-6b35be94bebd2fd871a37da8d7320f1f.png)
   7. Type in “All” and keep affirming. Without any specifications - the app
      will let you target all your contacts.  
      ![seg](/images/guides/getting-started/segmentdef-d492ce0e88c244a21f937fb1a7f9999c.png)
   8. Create two New Steps
      1. \_“Not Signed Up”\_At this Step, the User has yet to sign up for your
         service. When a condition is met, a trigger attached to this Step will
         activate and your User will continue to the next Step.
      2. “Signed Up” At this Step, the User has registered to your service. At
         this point, you’ll want to send them a Welcome Email to introduce them
         to your product.  
         ![two](/images/guides/getting-started/twojourneys-b791064028e014ed1441c36c727aa98f.png)
2. Create Trigger between the two nodes.
   1. Click the first node then click “Event Based” under “Triggers”.
   2. Click Add New Condition
   3. Under the Custom Field, write the following
      1. “Event”
      2. string
      3. is equal to
      4. “SignUp”  
         This means that once the Journey is active, it will await requests.
         However, it will only activate the trigger if the request contains an
         object, with the key`"Event"` with a value equal to `"Sign Up"` . If
         this is included in the body of the request, then the trigger will
         activate.
3. Drag the lightning bolt icon from one to the next.

![tre](/images/guides/getting-started/journeywithtrigger-a15b1be51e22289900eb1ab889dc1e5b.png)

Great! now the trigger of the first step is linked to the Second Step. This
means when the trigger is activated, the User will travel to the “Signed Up”
step, resulting in a message being sent to their inbox!

1. Select the “Signed Up” node
   1. Click E-Mail under Messages and select any template you have available.
   2. Click Export.
2. Click Save
3. Click Start.

Congratulations, your journey is now active!

## How to test your Journey[](#how-to-test-your-journey "Direct link to heading")

1. Open up Postman
2. Create a new workspace and create a new \***\*\*\***Collection\***\*\*\***
3. Change the dropdown to POST and the url to
   `[https://api.laudspeaker.com/event](https://api.laudspeaker.com/events)s/`
4. Click the Headers tab below where you’ve entered the URL.
   1. Under KEY, write `Authorization`
   2. Under VALUE, write `Api-Key XXXXXXXXXXX...`
      1. Replace the Xs with your actual API Key from Laudspeaker.
      2. You can find it in your Laudspeaker Settings under the API tab.
      3. **Please do not share your API key with anyone!**

![apihead](/images/guides/getting-started/apiheader-6678abf96f7eac2387141365a5f41935.png)

These last steps have made it possible for us to identify your Laudspeaker
account and correctly associate events. Our next step is to fire the trigger.
Once the trigger is fired, you should receive an email in your temporary email
address to confirm that the multistep journey has occured.

1. Click the Body tab in your Postman workspace and enter the following snippet
   of code. Make sure to replace the email with the temporary email associated
   with the test “person” you’ve added to your Laudspeaker Audience earlier in
   this tutorial.

![qwe](/images/guides/getting-started/postmanreq-ab7953e24554b83e404865cd045e0d34.png)

```json
{
  "correlationKey": "email", // This can be any key associated with the user
  "correlationValue": "target_user@email.com", // email of User
  "event": { "Event": "SignUp" } // Name of your Journey
}
```

The `correlationKey` and `correlationValue` will be the information required to
target the User in your Userbase. **If you are using the Free 3 Emails setting,
you must use your Account email.**

`event` refers to the event you specified in the trigger

Hit the big Send button. If you want to make sure things are going ok, you can
also open up the Console which is hidden in the bottom left.

You should get a 201 response code, indicating that the request has succeeded
and has led to the creation of some resource in Laudspeaker
