Setting up requires two parts: installation and testing

### Installation

The first step in setting up our product adoption tools is to install Laudspeaker. Currently we support installation via **npm** (node's package manager), and have a code snippet in beta. We will support other installation methods in the near future, please reach out if there is a specific method that matters to you.

To install via npm:

```
npm install --save @laudspeaker/laudspeaker-js
```

After npm install you will want to include the package in your application in the following way:

```
import laudspeaker from 'laudspeaker-js'

laudspeaker.init('<laudspeaker_api_key>', { apiHost: '<laudspeaker_instance_address>' });
```

Here is an example:

```
laudspeaker.init('3423444II21jU7GUfadfR9U1f', { apiHost: 'https://api.laudspeaker.com' });

```

you can see our github page here https://github.com/laudspeaker/laudspeaker-js

### Testing

To test the installation was set up correctly you can start your application, then in Laudspeaker you will want to design a simple modal, and create a simple journey. 

1. From the home page click on the modal designer option.

2. Feel free to design a basic modal.

3. Save the modal, and then navigate to the journey builder.

4. Drag a singe modal step, and specify the modal you just designed.

Select all customers - don't worry about filtering for a subset of users right now

You should see your modal pop up in your application if you set up correctly.

### Example App

We've included a sample app, based off of docusaurus here https://github.com/laudspeaker/example_modal_journey . You can see where we added the Laudspeaker code. All you'll need to do is add the correct api key and the application should work as intended.
