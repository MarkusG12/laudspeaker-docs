### Overview

As a marketer you can use Laudspeaker to create automated "customer journeys". You can use Laudspeaker to set up cross channel campaigns, that automatically send emails, sms, (and more) when users do specific things on your site or app, like sign up, or add an item to cart. These customer journeys often re-engage users at specific points in their life, and increase conversion or drive other KPIs that you care about.

### Use Cases
Common uses for customer journeys include automated onboarding, welcome emails, upsell, cross-sell, renewal or product adoption.

### Laudspeaker Breakdown
Laudspeaker makes it easy to create these campaigns with 3 main tools.
1) Our no-code drag and drop editor which we call our "journey builder." For more documentation on the journey builder see here and here. 
2) A template designer to design the actual messages, whether thats email, sms, push or in app. See documentation here and here
3) Segment builder to target and define lists of users who should be enrolled in a customer journey. See documentation here and here.

### What do I need to get started?

To get started you'll want to connect your app or site to laudspeaker, so you'll need the help of an engineer. We have made it exceedingly easy for engineering to integrate with us, and have docs for that here and here

We also partner with best in class email senders, sms providers and push senders, so you'll need an account with mailgun or sendgrid or twilio depending on your use cases. Once you have those, depending on your comfort level, you can add their api keys to our system yourself or have an engineer help.

Here's a checklist you can provide your engineer
