At present, you can set up messaging with Mailgun or Sendgrid. We are currently
working on integrating Mailchimp and SMTP into our software. If you’re just
trying out laudspeaker, we’ll give you 3 free email message broadcasts to see if
Laudspeaker is right for you. Here’s how you get set up:

1. Once you’ve logged in and verified your account, go to the “Home” tab on the
   right panel.

1. From the drop down list, select your preferred message broadcasting service.
   In this tutorial, we’ll set up with Free 3 Emails to keep things simple.
2. A short form will open up asking you to provide the following details:

1. Let’s send out an email. Go to Journey Builder and select
   “example-single-campaign”. This generates a default one-off message that will
   send as soon as the journey is activated.

1. Make sure to select a template for this message. Click the message first and
   then click “Email”. Select a template from the drop down menu. For this test,
   we can just use “example-template-action”

You should have an envelope icon next to your message now.

1. Define your customer segment! Click the button “Define Segment” under
   “Journey Type”

   created “All”

Since we don’t need to specify a customer segment, we can go ahead and click
“Save”

The email should now send to the target inbox. If you’re using the “Free 3
Email” setting, the message will send to your account’s email inbox.
