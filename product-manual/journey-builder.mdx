title: "Journey Builder"

## Introduction[](#introduction "Direct link to heading")

- The Journey Builder is our no-code drag and drop tool with which you can
  create complex flow charts describing which users should get messages and when
  they should receive them.
- We call each flow chart a “**journey**” and a journey has 3 main components,
  **steps**, **triggers** and **messages**. A journey can be made up of as many
  of those components as you want, can include time delays, branching and enough
  logic to include complex rules.
- We also require each journey to specify a “segment.” A segment is group of
  users to which the journey **_could_** apply. A segment is defined by user
  properties, you don’t need to specify the actual list of users, and a segment
  can be as specific or broad as you want meaning it a journey could affect your
  entire user base if you wanted.

## Examples:[](#examples "Direct link to heading")

Let’s take an example two step journey to make these concepts concrete, and then
we’ll provide more formal descriptions.

![Example Flow](/images/guides/product-manual/two_step-568d17efb763bbe80068b5d0e5675b20.png)

In this example we have two steps, “pre sign up” and “post sign up”.

The segment of users is intentionally left blank which means the segment
includes everyone (ie this journey could apply to every user).

![Example Flow](/images/guides/product-manual/segment-6bc6b564af2ec6c2c9bac5ddefd38e7c.png)

Our trigger is the Sign Up event. The post sign up step includes an sms
message - “Welcome to the app!”

![Example Flow](/images/guides/product-manual/custom_event-4f64dbe5e5f82ac49656d378c7e39c4f.png)

This journey specifies that any user who completes the Sign Up event moves from
the pre sign up step to the post sign up step, and once they move there they
immediately get an sms message “Welcome to the app.”

If you wanted to do something slightly different lets say you wanted the journey
to only apply to users who have credit card number on their user profile, and
you wanted the text message to go out one hour after sign up, you would set up
the journey like this:

![Example Flow](/images/guides/product-manual/three_step-9f7a393f53a18ed12f869ad47e32d54e.png)

The differences between the two include a segment definition in the second
example that filters users on having an a credit card number that “exists” and
we have a third step “after an hour get sms” that is triggered by a time delay
one hour after entering the step “post sign up”

## Recap of concepts[](#recap-of-concepts "Direct link to heading")

So to recap:

A step is some intermediate state a user can be, a state can include messages or
not. And when you start a journey you can check how many users are in any given
step at any point. If a step includes a message, the user will receive that
message **_as soon as_** they enter that step\*

A trigger is something that moves a user from one step to another step. It can
be event based like a sign up event or it can be time based, and we will soon
add more types of triggers.

A segment if a grouping of users that the journey could apply to. One way of
thinking about it is as a way to filter users. Maybe you want a journey to only
apply to users who have a specific attribute or maybe you want no filters.

A message can be of type email, sms, slack (in beta) or many more soon to come.

\*as soon as is an abstraction, in practice if you have thousands or millions of
users entering a step at once it will take time to send all those messages but
you should still treat it as instantaneous when coming up with your journeys.

## Starting, Pausing and Stopping a Journey[](#starting-pausing-and-stopping-a-journey "Direct link to heading")

Once you are happy with your journey and you want it to set it live, you simply
hit start. This will change the screen and your journey will now look like:

![Example Flow](/images/guides/product-manual/journey_stats-6c5155790f74a220219379290c0b7e94.png)

Each step will show some summary stats (in beta) summarizing how many users have
reached a step, along with different conversion metrics. If you click into a
step you will also be able to see a list of the users in that step.

If for any reason you need to pause or stop a journey, you can click those
buttons on the top right of the screen and no users will move steps at that
point, and no more messages will be sent. If you pause the journey you can
restart, but if you stop a journey you may not. If a user completes an action
that would normally correspond to some trigger while a journey is paused that
event is completely disregarded and the user will have to re do that action when
the journey is live for it to effect the journey.

## Defining triggers and matching events on your site or app[](#defining-triggers-and-matching-events-on-your-site-or-app "Direct link to heading")

### Custom Events[](#custom-events "Direct link to heading")

We have made Laudspeaker extensible so you can define and send events from your
site.

The general structure of custom events should be:

Given this structure, we can define a trigger like this:

For more details check out the custom events tutorial

### PostHog Events[](#posthog-events "Direct link to heading")

If you have set up the PostHog app, events are sent automatically to
Laudspeaker! To set it up check out the PostHog events tutorial.

Right now we support custom PostHog events, and can also capture pageviews and
autocapture events.

To filter on a pageview, you would set up a trigger like this:

To filter on a custom PostHog event you would set up a trigger like this:
