## Journey[](#step "Direct link to heading")
A journey is a tool that can help you interact with your user-base. It’s a
sequence of messages and automated communications that are triggered by how your
users interact with your service. You can build a journey to respond with a
“Welcome” email when a new user signs up. Another journey might act as a
reminder for a free user to upgrade their plan after a month of using your
service. With Laudspeaker, you can create a journey that works for you and your
user-base.

## Step[](#step "Direct link to heading")

Steps are the building blocks of a journey. They outline the way a User
experiences your Journey. As a User interacts with your service, they will
travel to the next step of the Journey. In some cases, you can create Journeys
with only one step. In such Journeys (known as One-Off Campaigns), the User will
receive one single message broadcast before the Journey completes. On the other
hand, longer Journeys can be active for a longer duration and consist of many
steps.

Some steps can have messages attached to them. When the User arrives at one of
these steps, they will receive the message attached to this step. This will then
prompt the user to interact more with your service.

## Trigger[](#trigger "Direct link to heading")

Triggers are the connective tissue of a Journey. Triggers allow you to move
between steps. They will only move the User to the next step if their condition
has been met. For example, if a user signs up to your service, a trigger will
activate. The user will now move along to a new step and a “Welcome” email will
be sent to them asking them to confirm their email. These triggers can be as
simple as a time delay. In other cases, a trigger may activate on the completion
of an Event.

## Event[](#event "Direct link to heading")

Events are actions that the User will complete which will result in the
activation of a trigger. For example, if a User signs up to your service and
checks a box which gives permission to send them “Offers and Discounts”, this
will trigger events in the future which will send Promotional E-mails to the
User’s inbox. Registering for a service, or Upgrading to a premium service all
count as events.

## Segment[](#segment "Direct link to heading")

A segment is the demographic of Users in your user-base. Think of this like a
filter. Sometimes you only need to communicate information to a specific subset
of your user-base. For example, a ticket-selling service might want to inform
ticket-holders of an upcoming show that the venue has been changed. With
Laudspeaker, they’d be able to select only those users with tickets for that
event and inform them where they’ll need to go.

<Info>Segments can be Dynamic or Static.</Info>

<Accordion title="Dynamic Segments">
Dynamic Segments require certain conditions to be met before a User is
considered part of that subset. Using the above example, When a User buys a
ticket to the upcoming event, they will be included in the Dynamic Segment of
_Users who have purchased a ticket to this event._
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Static Segments">
Static Segments are defined when created. It is impossible to join a Static
Segment if you were not part of it when it was originally defined. For One-Off
campaigns, Static Segments are the clear choice.
</Accordion>

## Template[](#template "Direct link to heading")

Templates are pre-written messages to send out to your user-base. Before they
are sent out, Laudspeaker will pull the User’s name and other details so that
the message is specific to the User. When a User activates a trigger with a
message attached, the template for that message will be filled in and sent out.
Use the Template Editor to format your templates to your liking. The editor is
highly customisable and can contain visual elements alongside text and
hyperlinks. Templates are a great place to display CTAs (Call-to-Action).

## Channel[](#channel "Direct link to heading")

Channels are simply the method by which a message is delivered to your
User-base. At the moment, the channels available with Laudspeaker are Slack, SMS
and E-Mail. We are currently working on adding more channels such as push
notifications.
