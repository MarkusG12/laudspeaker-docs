### Introduction
The People page, contains a view of all the users/customers you have interacted with - you could think of it as a mini CRM. We show the laudspeaker id, and an email (if it exists) for the users in the table.

If you click on any of the people listed, you will see their Profile, which includes information about them including user attributes and a timeline of communications they have recieved through Laudspeaker.

### Creating a Person
You can create people manually, or if you have an event integration set up, new profiles will be created automatically if an event with a new user reaches Laudspeaker.

To create a person manually, first click on the "create person" button on the people page. This will take you to an empty profile page like this:

You can now add attributes, by clicking on edit, and then on new attribute.

Finally when you are done, adding attributes, you must "add" and then you can "save".

### Editing a Person

You can also edit any person, whether you initially created the person manually, or if they were created automatically. Just click on edit, and change attributes.

### Syncing Users, Events and Profiles
If you want to import your users from a product analytics service (like PostHog), we can do that! This can currently be done in two ways, you can either set this up in Onboarding, or in Settings. Once completed the users will appear in the People page, and you can click on a user to see their attributes. The exact attributes that are shown will depend on the product analytics software you have synced from.

If you have an events integration, like the PostHog integration, if an event reaches Laudspeaker which has a user id that Laudspeaker has not seen before, we will automatically create a new profile. You do not have to do anything to set this up, beyond configuring the event integration. Here's an example for clarity: if we receive an event, which includes a user with an email "user@example.com" and the people page does not currently have a profile with "user@example.com" a new profile will automatically be created with that email.
