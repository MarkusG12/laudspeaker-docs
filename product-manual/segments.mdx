### Introduction
Segments are named lists of your users, that you can re-use and refer to multiple times in different parts of Laudspeaker. For example you could save a segment, "Users in Atlanta", and then whenever you want a journey to target users in Atlanta, you can simply resuse the "Users in Atlanta" segment instead of creating custom filters for each journey. Segments are generally useful for defining users you may want to target in specific campaigns and journeys.

You can include as few or as many people as you want in a segment, and Laudspeaker supports two main types of segments: Manual, Automatic. 

### Types of Segments

#### Manual Segments
Manual Segments are fixed lists of people that are defined by a Laudspeaker user explicitly. For example you could create a manaul segment through a csv import, or a database import. Once created the segment's membership does not change unless you explicity remove users from the segment, or add them.

#### Automatic Segments
Automatic Segments are lists of people that are defined by filters on sets of attributes, or actions they have taken. They are dynamic, and people join or leave the segments as they match or stop matching the filters. For example in the following segment

### Using a Segment in a Journey
You can use segment in a journey by selecting the member of operator like this:

then a list of your segments will show and you can select which segment you want to use. If you would like to perform further filtering on the segment you can do that as well in this part of the journey builder.
