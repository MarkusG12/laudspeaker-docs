## Channels[](#channels "Direct link to heading")

<Accordion title="Email">
We use industry standard libraries for our email designer, and include a drag
and drop html editor.

You can use the editor to design for desktop, mobile and other screensizes.

if you prefer to use other tools you can export that html and import it into
ours.

<Accordion title="Personalization">
Our template editor allows you to personalize your messages. You can use any
customer attribute to personalize a message, and we offer two ways of doing so.
Either by clicking on the personalize button and adding a tag, or with the
syntax: {{somethinghere}}

Right now we recommend only using personalization if you are sure that the
attribute exists for all your customers.
