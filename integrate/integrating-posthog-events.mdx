There are two steps:

1. Retrieve your Laudspeaker api key
2. Installing the Laudspeaker app on your PostHog account

## Laudspeaker api key[](#laudspeaker-api-key "Direct link to heading")

- Navigate to the settings tab and click on api, you should be able to find your
  api key there!

## Installing the Laudspeaker app on PostHog[](#installing-the-laudspeaker-app-on-posthog "Direct link to heading")

- All you have to do is navigate to the marketplace search for Laudspeaker and
  then click install.
- You will need to supply the Laudspeaker endpoint. If you are selfhosting this
  is under you domain, otherwise if you are using our hosted solution it is
  [app.laudspeaker.com/events/PostHog](http://app.Laudspeaker.com/events/PostHog)
- You will need to add the laudspekaer api key from before
- Finally you will need to supply the name of your email field. PostHog users
  often save emails under similar field names like "email" "$email", "Email".
  Specifying this information lets us know what to look for when persons are
  detected in PostHog
  - click save!

### One final thing!

- If you have users in PostHog already we recommend you check out the PostHog
  user import page as well
