### Custom events endpoint integration[](#custom-events-endpoint-integration "Direct link to heading")

- Example Post request

If you are using the custom events endpoint, you will want to make a request
like the following:

```json
POST /events/custom HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Api-Key iAnL3k5o3Sp41xin9J0ps0DM48swWFYpyuUvLUBI
Host: api.laudspeaker.com
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 107

{
    "externalId": "f5o3Sp41xin9J0gsd4354",
    "slackId": "U01T54ZD8CD",
    "event": "your_event_name"
}

```

[Here's a loom clip](https://www.loom.com/share/33671c05a0434b688afc5a6c744dc1e9)
showing how to test.

You can use the method pasted here and simply change \[YOUR FIELD\]

```ts
 async findByCustomId(account: Account, slackId: string): Promise<CustomerDocument> {
    const customers = await this.CustomerModel.find({ ownerId: (<Account>account).id, [YOUR FIELD]: [YOUR FIELD] }).exec()
    return customers[0];
    //return found;
  }

```

`this.customersService.findByCustomId(account, ev.[YOUR FIELD])`
