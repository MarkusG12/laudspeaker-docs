Laudspeaker customers can use their [Twilio SendGrid](https://SendGrid.com) account to send email through Laudspeaker, as well as keep track of email sending metrics like open and click-through rates. 

<Info>SendGrid offers both an SMTP client and a Web API. If you wish to use SendGrid's SMTP client, see our SMTP connection docs [here](/integrate/messaging-channels/email/smtp). For connecting with the SendGrid Web API, follow the guide below.</Info>

## Before We Begin: Creating an account
Before we can send emails using SendGrid, we must create a Twilio SendGrid account. Go to Twilio SendGrid's [signup page](https://signup.SendGrid.com/new/signup) and fill in the required information.

Twilio SendGrid requires new users to enter a phone number and business website but can be made for free.

<Warning>To send more than 100 emails per a day, you may need to upgrade your SendGrid account to a premium plan.</Warning>
## Creating API Keys

To begin making your first SendGrid API Key, you must use the [SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). Make sure to [add every API scope to your Admin level API key](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/authorization#admin-api-key-scopes) to recieve opened, clicked, and unsubscribed events.

For more help, go to [SendGridâ€™s Creating API Keys instructions](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-keys).
