Laudspeaker customers can use their [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) account to send email through Laudspeaker, as well as keep track of email sending metrics like open and click-through rates. 

<Info>Mailgun offers both an SMTP client and an HTTP API. If you wish to use Mailgun's SMTP client, see our SMTP connection docs [here](/integrate/messaging-channels/email/smtp). For connecting with the Mailgun HTTP API, follow the guide below.</Info>




## Before We Begin: Creating an account
Before we can send emails using Mailgun, we must create a Mailgun account. Go to Mailgun's [signup page](https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup) and fill in the required information.

<Warning>Mailgun requires new users to enter their payment information. For a completely free option, check out Laudspeaker's [email sandbox channel](/integrate/messaging-channels/email/sandbox).</Warning>
## Registering Sending Domains and Adding Authorized Recipients
### Sandbox Domain
Each new Mailgun account is automatically provisioned with a _sandbox domain_ of the form `sandbox<alphanumeric-identifier>@mailgun.org`. This domain allows you to perform all the core actions Mailgun offers without having to purchase or setup your own domain. All of Laudspeaker's functionality remains accessible using a sandbox domain.

Once you are ready, you can verify a domain for sending emails in production using the Mailgun [domain verification documentation](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#verifying-your-domain-1).
### Adding Authorized Recipients
<Check> If you are not using a sandbox domain, you can skip this step.</Check>

If you are using a sandbox domain, you will have to create _authorized recipients_ in Mailgun. These are verified emails that you can send to using the sandbox domain, and you can have up to five of them.

To add an authorized recipient, follow the instructions in [this article](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/217531258-Authorized-Recipients).
## Activating Webhooks
To receive _opened_, _clicked_, and _unsubscribed_ events, you will need to activate **Click Tracking**, **Open Tracking**, and **Unsubscribes** in the Mailgun UI.

1. From the [Mailgun Dashboard](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/dashboard), navigate to `Domain Settings` in the `Sending` drop-down menu, and select the domain you will be sending from in the top right corner of the screen:
