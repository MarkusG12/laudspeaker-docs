## PostHog events intro[](#posthog-events-intro "Direct link to heading")

You can think of PostHog events as falling into a few buckets. They are:

- Pageview
- Pageleave
- Autocapture
- Rageclick
- Custom Events

When you search on the events page on posthog you can tell these are the main
categories of events that posthog enables

- Pageviews are exactly what they sound like, you can use them to track which
  pages users were on. Pageleaves are similar.
- Autocapture tracks what users clicked on, as well as whether they input or
  submited something.
- Pageview/leave and Autocapture come out of the box if you are using the
  javascript snippet/library.
- Custom events are set up manually using `posthog.capture`.

## PostHog Events in the journey builder[](#posthog-events-in-the-journey-builder "Direct link to heading")

To use a posthog event you start off by clicking on event trigger, then changing
the dropdown to posthog.

You will see a text box, that shows the list of posthog events laudspeaker has
seen so far. If you don't see an event straight away - dont worry, the list
updates periodically and only when the event is sent to laudspeaker for the
first time.

### Using Pageviews[](#using-pageviews "Direct link to heading")

- Pageviews are a very powerful tool in designing journeys
- To use them effectively you will want to filter a page view on the url that
  you wish to trigger a message on
- You can do that on Laudspeaker like this:

- We do not yet support other filters (as off 2/3/23) but will add them soon.

### Using Autocapture[](#using-autocapture "Direct link to heading")

- Autocapture events correspond to "clicks", "changes", and "submits".
- In PostHog they look like these events:  
  ![live](/images/guides/integrate/phlive-8c4624d634d5eea44f870893c98f3819.png)
- We don't yet support filters on these events, so we would not yet recommend
  using them to trigger messages as they will not be specific enough to be
  useful. Our next release will add more functionality.

### Using Custom Events[](#using-custom-events "Direct link to heading")

- As mentioned before custom events are specified by the capture method.
- Here's an example of how we use the custom event: "SignUpProps"

In our application:

```js
posthog.capture("SignUpProps", {
  $set: {
    email: signUpForm.email,
    firstName: signUpForm.firstName,
    lastName: signUpForm.lastName,
    laudspeakerId: response.data.id,
  },
});
```

You can see the custom events in Laudspeaker:
