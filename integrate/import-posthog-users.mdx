## Configuring Laudspeaker[](#configuring-laudspeaker "Direct link to heading")

- Either on home or in settings, you’ll want to add your PostHog api key,
  project id and PostHog url (this is [app.PostHog.com](http://app.posthog.com/)
  if you aren’t self hosting). Finally if you have an email or phone number
  field on your users that you should specify what its called in PostHog, so
  Laudspeaker can use it. Then hit sync and youre good to go!
