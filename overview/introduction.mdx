Laudspeaker is: 

1) An open source set of developer tools to create high quality product onboarding experiences
2) An open source omni-channel customer messaging (engagement) platform. 

We make it easy for you connect with your users through in-product flows, emails, sms, slack and many
other channels. We offer a suite of tools including our no-code customer journey
builder with which you can create visual flows describing how, when, and where
customers should receive messages. The graphical interface allows you to build
complex messaging work flows the whole team can understand, and see stats in
single place once a journey is started.
