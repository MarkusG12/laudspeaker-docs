This tutorial will show with a very simple application, how to to set up an onboarding checklist in an application, as well as set up an accompanying user journey in laudspeaker's platform

### Setting up the app

Simply clone the project from our github repository here https://github.com/laudspeaker/side-checklist . All, you'll need to do is change the api key and the host url and the application should work as intended. Then go ahead and run two commands

```
npm install 
```

```
npm run start
```

If you navigate to localhost on your browser the application should look like this:

You should be able to click on the different buttons and minimize the checklist:

### Understanding the application

The relevant Laudspeaker code lies in two places, `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/SidePanel/SidePanel.tsx`

`App.tsx` contains

`import { LaudspeakerProvider } from "@laudspeaker/react";`

```
    <LaudspeakerProvider
      apiKey="hVHfu34n7vLgDx8UxkH9pB2ht3TH5nwZF6rSJhfm"
      apiHost="https://staging-app.laudspeaker.com"
    </LaudspeakerProvider>
```

Which is where you will want to set your api key and the apiHost should be changed to "https://api.laudspeaker.com"

`SidePanel.tsx` is where the checklist resides, and contains more code:

`import { useTracker } from "@laudspeaker/react";`

```
const { state, emitTrackerEvent } =
    useTracker<OnboardingTracker>("wacky-place-6727");
```

`useTracker` is the hook we use to share state with Laudspeaker, and `wacky-place-6727` is the generated id of the checklist component, you will need to replace this id with your id from the journey on Laudspeaker (more on this below). 

In this example each checklist item has a title, description, button text, and action as shown here:

```
interface StepFixture {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonText: string;
  buttonAction: () => void;
  done: boolean;
}
```

The button actions correspond to state transitions `emitTrackerEvent` in Laudspeaker, that we capture with an emit event, and are used in the journey builder.


The component `emits` and event that we can use on the Laudspeaker platform. In this case we call that event `click` but you could name it whatever you wanted

`useTracker('receptive-farm-8063')` identifies the component in our journey. The string `receptive-farm-8063` is randomly generated by Laudspeaker in the journey (shown in the next section). You will need to update the string with the whatever string is generated on your journey.

### Creating and starting our journey

We will now create a journey so that when a user clicks on the `send click` button on your app, the `name` field of the banner will change state. You can change the value to whatever you want, in this tutorial we will simply toggle between `a` and `b`

![2](/images/guides/getting-started/react_a.png)

So that Laudspeaker recognizes the banner component, we need to define the banners component's fields and events in Laudspeaker. To do that we go to the tracker template section of Laudspeaker:

![3](/images/guides/getting-started/component_template.png)

We then create the template like this:

![4](/images/guides/getting-started/template_d.png)

Now we can go to the journey builder. In our journey, we set the state of the name to be `a` initially. Then we **wait until** a user clicks on the button and emits a `click` event, which then changes the state of name to `b`. We then **wait until** there is another click event and loop back to the state `a`

This logic is represented by the following journey:

Here is a video showing how to build journey from scratch

### Putting it all together

Set the journey live, and then re-start the app. Now when you click on the button, it should change state!

This tutorial shows how the basic ideas behind Laudspeaker work in practice. 

Real onboarding components, can have as many fields and actions as you want and Laudspeaker can flexibly power many different types of experiences!
