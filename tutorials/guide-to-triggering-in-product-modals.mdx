In this guide, we assume you have set up modals correctly by following the set up guide.

### Identifying and Targeting users 

Modals, Tours, and other product Flows can be sent to select users based on their attributes, or actions. In order for Laudspeaker to be able to tell users apart you will need to **identify** the users to us. You can identify users in multiple ways:

a) Use Laudspeaker Identify call on login:

```
laudspeaker.identify(
  {'email': 'abe@laudspeaker.com',} // distinct_id, required
);
```

The laudspeaker identify call is available after npm installing laudspeaker and importing into your project

b) Use a product analytics system Laudspeaker integrates with like posthog.

### Testing that you are identifying correctly.

After adding the identify calls you can verify that call is set up correctly, by navigating to the people page. Any user who is identified for the first time should appear in the people table. 

If you are using posthog, you should also be able to navigate to the event-tracker page, and search for your event, and see the user events are being registered.

### Creating a journey with targeting.

Now we can get onto the fun part! We will set up a simple journey that will show a modal is a user carries out a specific action.

Navigate to the journey builder, and create a two step journey with a wait until, followed by a modal step:

In the wait until we will specify a single branch, where a user moves to the next step if they complete a sign up event. Our sign up event will assume a simple structure like this:

![w1](/images/guides/getting-started/w1.png)

![w2](/images/guides/getting-started/w2.png)

```
{
    "correlationKey":"email",
    "correlationValue":"abe@laudspeaker.com",
    "event":{"Event":"SignUp"}
}
```

Now set the journey live, allow all users to enroll.

![w3](/images/guides/getting-started/w3.png)

![w4](/images/guides/getting-started/w4.png)

To test the targeting has worked correctly, start up your app and navigate to the page that you want the modal to appear on. Now fire HTTP post request to Laudspeaker. Here's what we used with postman

```
POST /events/ HTTP/1.1
Host: api.laudspeaker.com
Authorization: Api-Key [your key]
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 110

{
    "correlationKey":"email",
    "correlationValue":"abe@laudspeaker.com",
    "event":{"Event":"SignUp"}
}
```
